# Exiting A Function

## Using yield
While moves the program moves out if the functions, it does not exit the function

Gives a generator which is stored at a certain memory address, which can be converted back to the original data type

Still retains the value of the local variables till the scope of the function, or when the function has been completely executed and all the variables have been used up

## Using return
Exits the function when called

Gives back the original value

Deletes all the memory of the local variable of the function
