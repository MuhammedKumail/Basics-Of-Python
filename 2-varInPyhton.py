# a few basic examples of immutable data types (may have same variables but have different data allocations):
# numeeric data types (integer, float, etc.): 
x = 2
x = 2.0

# string
str1 = "I am using Python"

# tuples (like lists but with different brackets):
tup = (1, 2, 3, "hello")

# a few basic examples of mutable data type (values can be updated at will and will have same memory allocaiton):
# lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 'hello']

# dictionaries
dict1 = {1: 'John', 2: 'Alice'}
