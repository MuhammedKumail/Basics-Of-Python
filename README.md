# Basics-Of-Python
An introduction to programming in Python

# Some Basic Terminologies
ðŸ‘‰ Object: everything in Python, including functions, variables and the values, different data types, etc, is called an object.

ðŸ‘‰ Memory allocation: allocating a memory to an object to store the data.

ðŸ‘‰ Mutable/Immutable data type: a category of data type, that when updated with new data, the memory allocation does not change, is Mutable, eg: lists, etc. And when the memory allocation changes, it is called mutable, eg: string, integer, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ Function: a set of commands, that tells the computer what task to perform. These can either be "Built-In" or "User Defined."

ðŸ‘‰ Built-In Functions: functions, when called, Python knows what task to perform, eg: sum(), reverse(), etc.

ðŸ‘‰ User Defined Functions: functions, whose task is determined by the user, eg: print(). A user can also create their own functions.

ðŸ‘‰ Class: different data types, like the lists, are different classes of variables. User can also create their own classes.

ðŸ‘‰ Instance: while creating variable, you basically create an instance of the class it belongs to.

ðŸ‘‰ Methods: like a function, but it is called on the object, and it represents what that object class can do.
